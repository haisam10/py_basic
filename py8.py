Python divides the operators in the following groups:

1. Arithmetic operators
2. Assignment operators ^
3. Comparison operators
4. Logical operators
5. Identity operators
6. Membership operators
7. Bitwise operators

# 2. Assignment operators
x = 5
sum = x + 5
print(sum)
# x = 5
x += 7 # x=5 ; X + 5  ; 5 + 5 = 10
print(x)

# ans = 12
x -= 5 # x = 12 ; X - 5 ; 12 - 5 = 7
print(x)

# ans = 7
x *= 5 # x = 7 ; X * 5 ; 7 * 5 = 35
print(x)

x /= 2 # x = 35 ; X / 5 ; 35 / 2 = 17.5
print(x)
